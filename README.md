# ItoEquationSolve

My experiments about Ito equation solve and using in financial mathematics

Ito's equation could be written in form

\[
dX_t = \mu(X_t, t) dt + \sigma(X_t, t) dW_t
\]

where:
- $\(X_t\)$ — random process,
- \(\mu(X_t, t)\) — drift function,
- \(\sigma(X_t, t)\) — diffusion function (volatility),
- \(W_t\) — Wiener process (brownian motion).
