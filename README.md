# Ito Equation Solve And My Financial Mathematics Experiments

My experiments about Ito equation solve and using in financial mathematics

Ito's equation could be written in form

$$dX_t = \mu(X_t, t) dt + \sigma(X_t, t) dW_t$$

where:
- $X_t$ — random process,
- $\mu(X_t, t)$ — drift function,
- $\sigma(X_t, t)$ — diffusion function (volatility),
- $W_t$ — Wiener process (brownian motion).

and another experiments in finance math.

## TODO
1. Numerical intergration of stoshastic equations
2. Using of different random process
3. Trying to modelling markets by that
4. Using newspaper data for sentiment analisys
